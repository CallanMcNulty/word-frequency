-----SPECS-----

Given a search term that does not appear in the searched string, return 0.
  Example Input:
    Search Term: "a"
    String: "I"
  Example Output: 0
  In this example "a" is a word that does not appear in part or in whole in any form in the searched string.

Given a search term that is equivalent to the searched string, return 1.
  Example Input:
    Search Term: "I"
    String: "I"
  Example Output: 1
  In this example the search term and string are both the single character "I".

Given a one character search term that appears in but is not equivalent to the searched string and appears only as a full word, return the number of appearances.
  Example Input:
    Search Term: "a"
    String: "I would like a hot dog."
  Example Output: 1
  In this example "a" appears once in the searched string as a full word but never as a substring of another word.

Given a one character search term that appears in the searched string multiple times, both as a full word and as part of another word, return only the number of appearances as a full word.
  Example Input:
    Search Term: "a"
    String: "I am a hot dog."
  Example Output: 1
  In this example "a" appears once in the searched string as a full word and once as a substring of another word.

Given a multiple character search term that appears in the searched string multiple times, both as a full word and as part of another word, return only the number of appearances as a full word.
  Example Input:
    Search Term: "am"
    String: "I am a programmer."
  Example Output: 1
  In this example "am" is a multiple character word which appears once in the searched string as a full word and once as a substring of another word.

Fulfill the previous spec even when words in the searched string are separated by non-whitespace characters.
  Example Input:
    Search Term: "am"
    String: "This is what I am: a programmer."
  Example Output: 1
  In this example "am" appears once in the searched string as a full word followed by punctuation and once as a substring of another word.

Fulfill all previous specs even when the case of the search term is not the same as the case of the matching word in the searched string.
  Example Input:
    Search Term: "am"
    String: "Am I a programmer?"
  Example Output: 1
  In this example "am" appears once in the searched string as a full word with differing case and once as a substring of another word.

Fulfill all previous specs even when the search term contains non-alphabetic characters.
  Example Input:
    Search Term: "that's"
    String: "That's what I am."
  Example Output: 1
  In this example "that's" is a full word containing punctuation which appears once in the searched string as a full word.

Given a search term containing multiple words, search for the full multi-word string, fulfilling all previous specs.
  Example Input:
    Search Term: "am what"
    String: "I am what I am."
  Example Output: 1
In this example "am what" appears once as a single string in the searched string, and "am" appears once on it's own.
